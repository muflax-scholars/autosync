Version 0.6
 * Minor fixes (logging typo and remove hardcoded /usr/share path in setup.py) 
   from Adam Spiers.
 * Reverse order of loading config files: first the default config, then the 
   one passed on the command line, so that the latter may override variables 
   from the former.
 * Refactoring by Giel van Schijndel: Move desktop notification and file change
   monitoring into own modules for better modularization. 
 * Refactoring by Sebastian Spaeth: Create our own dvcs-autosync Python module
   for cleaner cross-platform installation via setup.py and create a new 
   Autosync class in the main script to get rid of some global variables.

Version 0.5
 * Added Windows and Mac OS/X ports (thanks to Philipp Tölke and Olivier 
   Guerriat, respectively, for the ports!).
 * Added icon for notification popups (patch by evgeni@golov.de via Gitorious, 
   thanks!).

Version 0.4
 * Debian packaging.
 * Improved logging and notifications contributed by Dieter Plaetinck.
 * Added improvements by René 'Necoro' Neumann to make the embedded Jabberbot
   more stable with regards to reconnections. Instead of running a tight loop
   while trying to reconnect, ping the server regularly and queue the messages
   until the connection can be re-established.
 * Support configurable notifications (desktop notifications, XMPP, all, or 
   none).

Version 0.3
 * First public release, announced on vcs-home@lists.madduck.net.
